## Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/ruby/.yardoc/
/ruby/_yardoc/
/ruby/doc/
/ruby/rdoc/

## Environment normalization:
/ruby/.bundle/
/ruby/vendor/bundle
/ruby/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
/ruby/.rvmrc

# Don't bundle generated files
/ruby/visualizations
/ruby/json
/ruby/metadata.json
/ruby/compiled
